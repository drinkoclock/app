<h1>Drink O'Clock</h1>

<strong>https://drinkoclock.netlify.app</strong>

<p>A partnered project utilizing HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, and REST APIs to create a responsive web app. We decided to create an app that would receive user input via a drop down list of alcohol types, then return the user a random drink from the API return as well as the necessary ingredients and instructions required to make it. We were able to implement animations and smooth transitions, custom images and icons, a light/dark mode switch, and the ability to share a drink as a link as stretch goals.</p>
<p>Some issues we faced was the API did not have consistently formatted data or even English instructions for all results, so we had to implement a series of checks and some JavaScript functions to reformat certain results into more readable results</p>
